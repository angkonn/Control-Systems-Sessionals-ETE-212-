# Control-Systems-Sessionals-ETE-212-
This repository includes lab reports, MATLAB/Simulink projects, and practical work from my Control Systems Sessionals (ETE-212) course. It explores system modeling, stability analysis, feedback control, and other key control theory concepts through hands-on experiments and simulations.
